# Algorithm Via C++ STL Module Summary

STL is a C++ Standard Library that provide solutions to manipulating collections of data with modern efficient algorithms

STL has three components :
<ul>
<li> Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind.</li>
<li> Iterators common interface for all containers to step/traverse through the elements</li>
<li> Algorithms are used to process the elements of collections, such as search, sort, modify </li>
</ul>

There is four types of containers:
<ul>
<li>Sequence containers implement data structures that can be accessed sequentially. such as array, vector, deque, forward_list, list</li>
<li>Associative containers implement as Binary Trees to sorted data structures that can be quickly searched such as set, map, multiset, multimap</li>
<li>Unordered associative containers implement as Hash Tables to unsorted (hashed) data structures that can be quickly searched such as Unordered Set, Unordered Map, Unordered Multi set, and Unordered Multi Map</li>
<li>Container adaptors provide a different interface for sequential containers such as stack, queue, and priority queue</li>
</ul>
